# lhisp-mode

"Lots of hidden irritating silly parentheses" mode. Just hide them!

A mode to toggle the parentheses to the background color, making them effectively invisible.

99.9% was generate with claude.ai, as my elisp skills are close to 0.

This mode is experimental (meaning not battle tested).

Place this file in your Emacs config folder. For prelude, it's `.emacs.d/personal/`
